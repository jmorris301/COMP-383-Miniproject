E. coli is a model organism. The strain E. coli K-12 was isolated from the stool of a convalescent diphtheria patient in 1922,
and it has been used in the lab for nearly 100 years. (The first ½ is documented in an interesting paper – Bachmann 1972
(PMID: 4568763)). It was one of the first organisms to have its whole genome sequenced. It was such a big deal it was published
in 1997 in Science! Most researchers either buy their strain from a stock collection or know the history of their strain
(i.e., who gave it to them, who gave it them, etc.). These strains are going to Inevitably evolve over time. Recently, 
researchers have returned back to these K-12 strains to resequence them and ones that were derived (evolved) from the original
K-12 strain.

Write a Python script to automate the following and produce the output file requested named “OptionA.log” and files listed below
in a folder named “OptionA_FirstName_LastName” [where you’ve indicated your first and last name]. ALL results generated by you or
programs called should be written to this folder. [The easiest way to guarantee this is to create the folder and then move into it
via an os.system call using cd (change directory).]
