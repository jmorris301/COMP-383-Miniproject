# COMP-383-Miniproject
## README.md for miniproject on E-coli K12

This is the repository running my python script which will automate resequencing of EcoliK12 data. The purpose of resequencing is due to the evolution of the K12 strain. These give rise to derivations over time require that resequencing of modern strains derived from the original K12 strain. 

The pipeline is run in python3 and requires several software and installation tools including: 
* SPAdes
* Prokka
* Tophat2 
* Bowtie2
* Cufflinks 
* SRA-toolkit
* wget

The files and subdirectories in the pipeline will be written to a directory created called `OptionA_Jack_Morris`
Certain command outputs will be written to `OptionA.log`
